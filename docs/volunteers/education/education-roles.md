There are several roles that you can take when volunteering with the Education Team which have varying levels of time commitment and planning.

## Module Lead

**Time Commitment**: 3 consecutive weeks plus planning time

The module leaders lead the preparation of a module's lessons and exercises and are responsible for delivering its content.
The module leaders are normally from within the group of mentors who have been around from the previous cohort and have a good feeling about how to run a class.
They don't necessarily teach the full Saturday class though, as they're normally supported by other mentors who wish to teach part of it.

## Lead Teacher (& Assistant Lead Teacher)

**Time Commitment**: 3 consecutive weeks plus planning time

If you wish to support the lead mentor on a particular part of the module syllabus, then please talk to him/her and they can get you organised to teach in a class.

## Teaching Assistant

**Time Commitment**: One teaching day per week

This is where most new mentors start as it is a good way to get to know the students and the other mentors.
What the role involves: During the class, new concepts and exercises are introduced by the lead mentors. The students are then expected to practice these with hands-on exercises. The in-class assistants help students if they get stuck or they need some clarification.
Mentors are not expected to come every weekend, although advanced absence notification is appreciated.

## Mid-week help

**Time Commitment**: Flexible

Some mentors can't commit their Saturdays but they are able to meet students midweek to help with homework, provide group project support, or help them get a better understanding of the concepts they're learning. This is evolving into a parallel stream of work that is just as valued and important as the main Saturday class.
Normally, volunteer mentors offer help on a certain day of the week (few hours after work for example) and students respond if they can join.
This can also be requested by the students by asking if there are mentors available to help on specific day(s).
All communication is done via the cohort's Slack channel.

## Student-Mentor pairing

**Time Commitment**: A few hours a week, long term

This is a new role we are trialing at the moment.
It consists of pairing one student with one mentor for a few weeks. The mentor becomes the student's first point of contact and is responsible of reviewing their homework (or delegating the review to other mentors) and escalating if they feel the student need extra help.

## General online help

**Time Commitment**: Flexible

Sometimes students ask for clarifications or questions related to particular homework exercises on the Slack channel. Any mentor can reply on the same platform and thus provide a benefit to the rest of the students.

## Homework review

**Time Commitment**: Flexible

The homework is done as Pull Requests on the students' GitHub accounts. Mentors review and provide feedback that the students should act on.

## Graduation Project

**Time Commitment**: Six weeks at the end of the course

The graduation projects, at the end of the course, require developers who are comfortable jumping into several different roles: Being the architect of the project, Lead developer taking responsibility of PRs and their quality, a lot of Project Management and wearing the hat of Scrum master few times. If you'd like to get involved in one or few of those roles, please let one of the lead mentors know.

## Non-technical Support

**Time Commitment**: Flexible

There are also a lot of admin and management tasks involved in running the project and this responsibility is shared between a handful mentors. Examples of these are: help manage the new student application process, contact potential employers, respond to emails and other general management tasks.
We expect people to be around for a bit before getting involved with this side of things, but if you are interested in helping out then please let us know.
