title: Student Interviews
---

Before every new class, we make sure to interview our potential students as a final step before acceptance into the course.

### Aims

- Get to the know the students
  - This is the first time we've ever met them! We have to be sure we can work with them for the next eight months
- Assess that the students have retained the knowledge they have learnt in the previous steps
  - We should also confirm that the students actually did the work themselves
- Assess the students have a good level of spoken English
  - Students can get help from friends and family for written work

## Interview Days

Interview days generally run the whole day and require a large number of both technical and non-technical volunteers.

As students arrive they should be taken to a quiet space with one technical volunteer (someone who understands code) and one non-technical volunteer.

Together they should complete this form:

[Student Interview Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ps6CEPPr_50hBmmXBPKwogAGRwnGnJr7GccUekdHqjM/edit)

The class coordinator should duplicate this form for each Class. Please contact your class coordinator for access to this Google form.

## Roles

### Greeters

Make sure you have at least two volunteers welcoming the Applicants to the interviews. Record their attendance, give them a tour of the premises and get them a coffee or a tea. These interviews can be very intimidating for some of our applicants so you should take time to make sure that people feel welcome and safe.

Take time to explain that the interviews are to get to know them better and that if they've made it this far then we think they have great potential.

### Interviewers

Both technical and non-technical volunteers should:

- Aim to be as objective and fair as possible
- Be mindful of their biases
- If in doubt, record more information than you think is necessary

## Student Selection

### Guide

When selecting students your primary aim should be to answer this statement.

    I can imagine working with this student over the next eight months and I believe that they show the potential and drive to complete the course.

Everything outside of this is nice to have.

### Upper Bounds & Lower Bounds

When selecting students it is important to keep in mind that a student can be of too high ability as well as too low.

A student with too low ability may

- not understand English to a sufficient level
- not be able to explain their code well enough
- not show a particularly great drive to be a programmer

A student with too high ability may

- already know how to program to an advanced level
- have studied programming for a prolonged period of time
- be capable of getting a programming job already

It's important to spot both lower and upper bound students as our course may not be the right fit for them at this time.

For lower bound students, a referral to a less intense programming course or further English lessons may be a better solution. Our course can be very challenging for people and if we're not sure that they're ready then we should endeavour to be upfront and supportive whereever possible.

For upper bound students, it may be preferable to give them the skills they need to be able to get a job and have them start applying. This could take the form of personal development lessons or some sessions working on our tech projects. We're in the business of finding jobs for the people and if the most efficient way to do that is by **not** joining our course then that is the best outcome.
