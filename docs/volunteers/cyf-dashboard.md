## What is this?

The dashboard is the key organisation tool that we use to coodinate CodeYourFuture. It is mainted and developed by our graduates.

## What does it do?

Currently it supports the following features:

- [Application Process](volunteers/application-process.md)
  - Including managing the steps that applicants have to complete to join the course
- Volunteer Sign Ups
- Cities
- Teams

We also have these feature in development

- Volunteer CRM
- Events
- Expenses

## What problem does it solve?

When we started we would manually contact each of our applicant by email and phone calls with very little visibility on who was conducting each past of the application process.

As we've grown, we've found that this has become a a bottleneck for the organisation and so we built a tool to help us manage that. This application process tool has grown into the Dashboard that you see today.

## What does it look like?

## How do I get access?

You can sign up on the website and then talk to a city coordinator to be accepted.
