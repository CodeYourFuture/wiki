### Contacting NGOS and other referral organiations

```
**Unless you are starting new chapter of CYF - skip ahead to point 3.**

1. Research and collate contact details of a significant number of charities, NGOs, educational establishments for adults, training centres, and community groups that work with refugees, asylum seekers, and other disadvantaged (i.e. low-income, disabilities etc.) As a starting point, we recommend at least 50 organisations, and ideally 100+ organisations. 

2. Upload these organisations into Google Spreadsheet in your city folder and organise them based on their relevance to the course - there will be signs to suggest that certain organisations or groups are more likely to provide suitable applicants for CYF than others. Prioritise those that you believe to be the most likely source of applicants. 

```

3. Start calling NGOs - you will get the NGO list emailed to you. Some organisations may have undergone changes since we last called them, please update as you go.  

4. Making a call takes around 10mins - best done during the day when the NGOs are open. Lunch times have worked well in the past. 

5. The first email will be sent from by an volunteer or CYF staff member with a CYF email address. Your job is to follow up that email with a call. 

6. Try to speak to the right contact at the NGO - or if not, get their name for a follow up email. 

7. Send a flyer in a follow up email. Organisations can print them out or and pass them onto students directly - it is a physical manifestation of an opportunity. You will be sent the latest flyer via email. If you don't have a flyer, ask CYF.  

6. Update the list with the next steps, eg. Jo from Refuaid wants more details. The project organiser - with a CYF email address - will follow up on the requests from the NGOs.

7. NGOs need to be called back within a month. NGOs are often busy doing other things, so a second call, especailly to big referrers, is critical. 

As a volunteer, you are likely only to call NGOs once.

### Calling Applicants

There are three stages for an applicant:

- An online course - tutorials and the creation of mini web projects. If they succeed in this, they are invited for an interview (if they pass the eligability criteria. These tutorials and mini projects usually take a few weeks - longer if people haven't coded before: https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/volunteers/application-process. 
- A fundamentals intensive - a month long, with classes on the weekends: https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/volunteers/fundamentals
- The full 8-month course: https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/volunteers/the-course

While the applicants are working on the tutorials, it is important at this time to call an applicant and ensure that they are clear about the process, are receiving emails and are actively working on the tutorials. 

Many applicants suffer from isolation and depression, so a call at this stage can provide a lot of motivation to students.

Once you have called an applicant, record this call on the dashboard and move onto the next one.

### Facebook Groups

- Research relevant Facebook groups. A lot of disadvantaged people join communities on Facebook for their geographical location i.e. Iraqi Refugees in London etc. These are great sources of applicants.

- Work with your local organisers to get access to the list of previously used Facebook Groups for your region / country.  

### Word of mouth

- Use the CYF Slack channels! Post in your city and general channels when the drop ins are due to start. Of the last 110 people who completed step 1 in London - 50% came from word of mouth! 

### Workshops

- Make sure the events calendar on codeyourfuture has the next workshop dates. Create an eventbrites and invite applicants to these coding workshops.
