## Questions

### Is this course recognised by employers?

Most jobs don't ask for a degree, however, more and more companies recognize the CYF course as a Full Stack Development bootcamp. Bootcamps in general are becoming a more popular way to study as a developer.

### Do we have any Saturdays off during school half term break, Easter or during the summer?

Yes, we have some time off for holidays. You should speak to your course coordinator or teachers to find our when they are.

### Do I need to be good at maths?

Maths is not as important in development as many people think it is. The computer can do the maths for you, though it can be helpful to understand how and why a calculation is being carried out. Where necessary, we will also explain the maths involved in an exercise :) That being said, being good at maths or better at thinking more logically can work to your advantage. Different ways of thinking lead to different solutions!

### What is after the Fundamentals Course?

After finishing the Fundamental Course successfully you will go through to the main course where you will start coding on your own machine and the core syllabus will start (https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/) 

### Do all students move from the Fundamentals course to the main course?
We absolutely want all students to join the main course. The Fundamentals module is both an introduction and a taster for you. If after this part of the course you realize you are no longer interested in coding, or you are finding it way too difficult, you then have the opporuntity to make a decision about whether to continue. In those cases, we will be sure to sit down and talk with you to make sure you are making the decision you want to make.

### How to build a personal network in the coding industry?

It can be a good idea to get involved in the local coding meet ups and groups if you want to meet other people learning to code, or people who already work as developers. Some you can look into attending in Manchester are Code Up, codeandstuff, Barcamp, codebar, and local hackathons. In the future we will create a list of events and groups for you all, but we will always share information about upcoming events when we hear about them too. During the course, we will be working with each of you on things like your CV, LinkedIn profiles, etc. and you can get some tips from our personal development team during these sessions about how to network.

### Do you need a certificate to become a developer?

No, most jobs ads don't ask for a degree. Some positions may ask for a degree, however, you can always apply as in some cases it's simply the company’s policy to ask for a degree even if it's not essential for the role.

### What is after CYF?

It depends on your goals. Most graduates seek employment, some seek further studies, however, the course will prepare you to find a job as a Full Stack Developer. In addition to technical material, CYF provides personal development, help with writing CVs, creating a LinkedIn account, networking and more.

### How many days can the student be absent?

#### Also: Can we request a day off in advance if needed?

We recommend you to attend all of the Saturday sessions in order to not miss the content we are teaching, but we understand that you may become ill, go on holiday, or need to take time off for things like childcare or emergencies. If you need to miss a Saturday class, this is okay, but understand that we will expect you to study to catch up. We will contact you if you miss a class and explain what you have missed, but we won’t have time to teach the whole class again the next week, as the rest of the class will need to keep progressing. We trust that you will attend unless there’s a good reason you can’t come. If you miss many classes, you are likely to start falling behind, in which case we will talk with you about whether you are taking the course seriously.

### Will I be able to use Khan Academy after the course finishes?

Yes, all online course sites we will use through the course will be free including Khan Academy, Coursera, CodeAcademy. 

### What should I do to avoid jamming all the information in my head?
You should not be trying to memorize all the information you take in over the course. It is impossible to remember everything and no developer will ever work in this manner. As you move between roles and responsibilities, you may find yourself using some skills more than others, and over time your knowledge may become stronger and weaker in certain subjects about coding. This is okay! This is where the internet will help you. Yes, it is okay to research! One of the best resources out there is [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Familiarize yourself with it early on.

### When I get stuck, what questions can I ask myself to figure out what the problem is?
It will be hard at first to know what to ask yourself, but one way around this is to use pseudo code. Psuedo code refers to readable instructions and notes that help guide the developer through their code as they create each function or part of the code. When looking back over your code, this pseudo code can be helpful in finding out what your problem is. For example, let's say you build a calculator and one instruction you wrote for yourself is 'add two numbers together'. When you look back and realize you maybe used '-' instead of '+' between the two numbers, that instruction you left for yourself might give you a hint on what to look for. As you progress through the course, you will also learn how to 'debug' code in an effective way. Debugging simply means to fix a problem in your code.

### Can you give tips on asking great questions when seeking help getting unstuck?
Great questions are clear, detailed and contextual. Avoid asking general questions that don't provide the person you're asking with any information. A great example we covered in class was looking up on Google how to find the child element in CSS. If we search something more general like 'how to get a child', we will end up with some pretty unusual results not related to code!

### How to control your nerves when you working in front of someone. This includes mentors or even friends.
At CYF, we will never be judging you or your skills. We know you are learning. We also understand that some people work better when nobody is watching. You are completely free to ask a mentor to come back to you after you have had some time to think about the problem. Coding in front of somebody can be as nervewracking as making a speech or something similar. Basically, you are afraid of making a mistake. Learning to code will be full of mistakes and this is where you will learn the most, so try not to think too much about it when a mentor or classmate is around when you're coding :)
