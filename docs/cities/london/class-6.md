## How to volunteer with this class

If you're a new volunteer, joining as a teaching assistant is a great way to get to know our students and provide a really valuable service. 

As a Teaching Assistant you'll be working closely with our students and helping our Lead Teachers in delivering our content. No teaching experience is required and you'll be supported throughout the day. 

We teach most Sundays the class will then start at 11:00am it'd be great if you could arrive a bit early - around 10:30am - for a quick onboarding. 

Please add your name and email address to the Schedule sheet below to confirm your attendence and email ldn-edu-core@codeyourfuture.io with the subject `New Volunteer at Class on [DATE_OF_CLASS]` and introduce yourself. We'll then guide you through the day!
