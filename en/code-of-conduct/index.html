We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form, and sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any community activity.</p><h2>Harassment</h2><p>Harassment is a form of discrimination in the UK under the Equality Act 2010. Discrimination which is against the Equality Act is unlawful. This means action can be taken against you in the civil courts. Harassment may be verbal, non-verbal, or physical. Examples of unwanted conduct are:</p><ol><li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion</li><li>Offensive and suggestive remarks (including via emails, messages and other electronic communications, posters, objects, written materials or graffiti)</li><li>Intimate questions</li><li>Foul or obscene language</li><li>Innuendo and derogatory comments</li><li>Jokes, banter, teasing, nicknames, ridicule or insults</li><li>Inappropriate comments about dress, appearance, physique or abilities</li><li>Persistent requests for social activities (after it has been made clear that such requests are unwelcome) or other persistent unwelcome attention of a personal nature</li><li>Whistling, winking or suggestive or offensive gestures</li><li>Deliberate ignoring or isolation of a community member</li><li>Inappropriate physical contact (including touching, standing too close, pinching, pushing and grabbing)</li><li>Sustained disruption of talks, working groups or other events</li><li>Unwelcome sexual attention or suggestive behaviour (which the harasser may perceive as harmless)</li><li>Threats, assault or coercing sexual acts</li><li>Racist, sexist, homophobic or ageist jokes, or derogatory or stereotypical remarks about a particular ethnic or religious group or gender</li><li>Mocking, mimicking or belittling a person&#x27;s disability</li><li>Sexual images in public spaces</li><li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li><li>Harassing photography or recording</li><li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour</li></ol><p>A person may also be harassed even if they were not the intended target. For example, a person may be harassed by racist jokes about a different ethnic group if the jokes create an offensive environment. Our position is that no harassment of any kind should take place and all community members have a responsibility to ensure at all times that their own behaviour does not offend others. The Equality Act defines harassment as where behaviour is meant to or has the effect of either violating dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. This means it is harassment even if the harasser did not mean to offend or intimidate, as long as the harassment has one of the above effects.</p><h2>Bullying</h2><p>Bullying is any behaviour or action (whether physical, verbal or non-verbal) that is offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting intended to undermine, humiliate, denigrate or injure the recipient. It also includes an abuse or misuse of power, deliberately setting an individual up to fail and unjustified intimidation.</p><p>In addition to the examples listed for harassment above, bullying may also include but is not limited to:</p><ol><li>Shouting in public</li><li>Persistent or unfair criticism</li><li>Ostracising people</li><li>Physical or psychological threats and instilling fear</li><li>Spreading malicious rumours</li><li>Constantly undervaluing effort/achievement</li><li>Withholding information</li></ol><h2>Responsibilities</h2><p>Community members have a responsibility to behave in a way that is not offensive to others and to acknowledge that views and opinions held by others may not always coincide with their own.</p><h2>Reporting</h2><p>If you are being harassed or bullied or notice that this is happening to someone else, or have any other concerns, please let a mentor know. We will help take appropriate actions to stop this behaviour, and will not take any actions without your agreement and consent. If you would prefer to report anonymously, <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/OvIFhRTpuGO6AXtA3">please use this form</a>.</p><h2>Enforcement</h2><p>Community members are asked to stop any harassing behaviour and perpetrators are expected to comply immediately. We retain the right to take any actions to keep the community a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or exclusion from the program if the situation does not improve.</p></section></div></div><footer class="nav-footer" id="footer"><div class="wrapper"><section class="sitemap"><h5>CodeYourFuture</h5><nav><ul><li><a href="https://codeyourfuture.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Website</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/CodeYourFuture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/CodeYourFuture_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/codeyourfuture.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a></li><i><a href="https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/wiki">This website is open source.
